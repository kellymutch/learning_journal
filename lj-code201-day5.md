 Good lecture day. Lots of good information. Made a stupid mistake of having the code for the lab open during lecture so when I started, I did not have Sam's already did the first part available and wasted time trying to recreate from scratch when I am already sucking at the code. Overheard there was an issue with the original and on a reload was able to complete the second step no problem. Still head banging on the rest.
