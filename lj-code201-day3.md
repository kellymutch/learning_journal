Day 3 was a panic day. We had two additions to the about me project that needed to include if else/if stuff and looping thru an array. My brain just seized up and I didn't start out with a plan. Really need to put stuff together piece by piece, step by step and verify that it works before moving to the next step. Woke up at 4am and started working on it again. Such a bunch of wasted energy on my part.
